### More Information 

In 2007, I joined the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department at the University of Barcelona (UB) as Full Professor, where I teach an introductory course on Algorithms and advanced courses on Collective Intelligence and Computer Vision for Human and Object Recognition. From April 2011 I am serving as Head of the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department, UB. <br>
From 1991 to 2006, I have taught Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Science Department at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). I have also been responsible of doctoral and master studies (until September 2007) at the Computer Science Department, UAB. <br>
My research, when personal computers had 128KB of memory, was originally oriented towards digital image analysis and how to extract quantitative information from them, but soon evolved towards computer vision problems. After a postdoctoral year at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993, I focused on Bayesian methods for computer vision methods. Now, I am the head of a research group working in face processing, object detection and recognition and social perception. <br>
I have been always interested in connecting my academic work to its social environment, and since 1993 I have been involved in several projects to transfer academic knowledge to industrial production, medical diagnose or telecommunication applications. The main result of this interest was born in 2004, when I co-founded (with P.Radeva and A.Tovar) Inspecta S.L., a technology start-up company. Inspecta’s vision is based on the belief that artificial vision and cognitive systems can be a key factor for competitiveness, even for traditional sectors like cork industry.
